# Taiko CI
Simple implementation of Taiko test automation library running in Gitlab CI.

## What you'll get
* Two complete Docker images to choose from: one with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager, the other with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - modern, efficient alternative to npm.
* Gitlab CI job template. It's so self explanatory, it can be easilly adopted to other CI servers, like Jenkins.
* Sample test case script.
